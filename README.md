# CSGO Scraper
Used to scrape most recent 1 star matches for CSGO and to get the scores, maps, and winner. This is a library that is currently used by a twitter bot that can be found here: [@go_stats](https://twitter.com/go_stats) [repo](https://github.com/lpbearden/go_results_bot)


### TODO
- [ ] hookup db or some sort of storage to store match data
- [ ] scrape individual player stats
